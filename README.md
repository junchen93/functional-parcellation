This repo is code for functional parcellation, which is under construction.

### work flow
1. pre-processing of fMRI time series
2. calculating the functional density and edge maps for each subject
3. register all these maps into a common space so that very sharp group averages can be generated by spherical demons (SD) was used in this process.
4. group level parcellation
5. Individual level parcellation
